This is the implementation of our paper: "Building Maps for Autonomous Navigation Using Sparse Visual SLAM Features" in IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2017. Our implementation is built on the top of the open-source stereo SLAM [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2). It runs in ROS （developed in version of indigo）. Eigen, OpenCV, and CGAL are needed.
